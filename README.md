# KVM

## Introduction

I am using [KVM](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-KVM)
with [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) for local virtualization.
Performance is good and works for me.
Setup VMs is a timely task, so I am using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for creating and managing VMs.
